<h1 align="center">UR-5 Ball in Cup Environment</h1>


<div align="center">
  This repository contains the code to use RL on a UR5 robot with the traditional ball-in-cup game. The necessary package and basic instructions are presented.
  Before running this environment, ensure that the following requirements are met:

</div>

## 1. Clone and Install Python URX Package

1. Clone the Python URX repository from GitHub:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/UoA-CARES/python-urx.git
  ```
2. Navigate into the cloned repository directory:
  ```
  cd python-urx
  ```
3. Install the Python URX package in editable mode using pip:
  ```
  pip install -e .
  ```

## 2. Install Math3d Package

1. Install the `math3d` package version 3.4.1:

```
pip install math3d==3.4.1
```

## 3. Test the simulation

A helpful Docker file is available for testing ideas in simulation. Simulation provides a safe environment to experiment 
with new ideas without risking the real robot. So highly recommended to uses. In a new terminal run: 

```
sudo docker run --rm -it   -p 6080:6080 -e ROBOT_MODEL=UR5 -v "${HOME}/ur_programs:/ursim/programs" universalrobots/ursim_e-series
```

Then open a web browser and past the following link and press connect
```
http://172.17.0.2:6080/vnc.html?host=172.17.0.2&port=6080
```

You will be able to view the control screen panel exactly as it appears on the real robot. Simply follow the same 
initialization setup used for the real robot.



## 3. Test the real robot

Run the provided `general_test_example.py` example to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```
python general_test.py
```

It is recommended to create a Conda environment
